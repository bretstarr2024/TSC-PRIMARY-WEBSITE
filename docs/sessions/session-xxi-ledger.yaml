    message: "docs: Session XXI roadmap update — services CTA direct-to-book"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/services/ServiceCategoryStrip.tsx — 'Explore {name} →' ghost buttons replaced with 'Let's Talk about {name}' tangerine primary CTAs linking to /book?service={name}"
  - "app/book/page.tsx — Added useSearchParams() to read ?service= param, shows 'You're interested in / {service}' context above calendar, prefills Cal.com notes with service interest, Suspense boundary added"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XXI entry added, upcoming session renumbered to XXII"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Service hub CTAs go directly to /book instead of service sub-pages"
    rationale: "User feedback: the sub-pages are a middleman. Prospects clicking a service CTA have high intent — send them straight to booking. Sub-pages still exist for SEO and direct navigation."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Service name passed as query param (?service=) rather than slug"
    rationale: "Human-readable display on the book page ('You're interested in Brand & Positioning') without needing a lookup. Cal.com notes also get the readable name."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Cal.com notes prefilled with 'Interested in: {service}'"
    rationale: "Gives the sales team context about what the prospect clicked before they even join the call. Zero friction for the prospect."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Buttons changed from variant='secondary' (ghost) to variant='primary' (tangerine)"
    rationale: "These are now the primary conversion action on the services hub — they deserve primary button treatment."
    reversible: true
