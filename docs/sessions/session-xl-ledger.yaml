    message: "feat: Hero composition polish — GAME OVER gradient, spatial refinements"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/home/HeroSection.tsx — Moving gradient on GAME OVER, arcade button mb-6→mb-10, subhead max-w-2xl→max-w-[600px] text-xl→text-lg, coin slot mt-8→mt-20, level up white bold"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XL section added, Session XLI upcoming"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Replace solid LED glow with animated moving gradient on GAME OVER headline"
    rationale: "User directive — gradient sweeping through brand colors (Atomic Tangerine → Neon Cactus → Tidal Wave) is more dynamic and visually striking than static orange glow."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Use drop-shadow filter on parent div for headline glow instead of textShadow"
    rationale: "bg-clip-text with text-transparent makes textShadow invisible. drop-shadow on parent creates glow from rendered letter shapes."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Change 'level up' from animated GradientText to plain white bold"
    rationale: "User directive — gradient treatment moved to the headline, so subhead gets clean treatment. White font-semibold provides emphasis without competing."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Narrow subhead from max-w-2xl (672px) to max-w-[600px] with smaller text"
    rationale: "User directive — text needs to fit more neatly inside the sphere. Stepped down from md:text-xl to md:text-lg to maintain 2-line layout."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Push coin slot from mt-8 to mt-20 (80px)"
    rationale: "User directive — coin slot should sit just below the sphere in the background, not overlap with it."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Increase arcade button spacing from mb-6 to mb-10"
    rationale: "User directive — more breathing room between 1-player button and GAME OVER headline while staying inside sphere."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "MongoDB interactions collection still has no indexes"
    mitigation: "Create indexes via Atlas UI: {timestamp:-1}, {ctaId:1,timestamp:-1}, {sessionId:1,timestamp:1}, TTL 180 days"
    severity: low
  - risk: "Resend email infrastructure still not configured in Vercel env vars"
    mitigation: "Add RESEND_API_KEY, LEAD_RECIPIENTS, RESEND_FROM to Vercel project settings"
    severity: low
  - risk: "drop-shadow + bg-clip-text combination may render differently across browsers"
    mitigation: "Tested in Chromium. Verify in Safari/Firefox. Fallback: move glow to a duplicated text layer behind the gradient text."
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "Contact page form with Resend email notifications — next session"
  - "MongoDB indexes on interactions collection — Atlas UI manual step"
  - "Vercel env vars for Resend — manual setup"
  - "Pipeline infrastructure from AEO — future sessions"
  - "Chatbot (chaDbot) deployment — future session"
  - "Content generation crons — future sessions"
  - "Vercel Analytics initialization — future session"

next_actions:
  - "Verify hero gradient and spatial layout in production across browsers"
  - "Create MongoDB indexes on interactions collection via Atlas UI"
  - "Add Resend env vars to Vercel"
  - "Build Contact page form with Resend email notifications"

  - "CTA button text is 'New Game' site-wide (except pricing cards)"
  - "CoinSlotCTA renders at native 128×128 with imageRendering: pixelated"
  - "GAME OVER headline uses animated moving gradient (not solid LED glow)"
  - "'level up' in subhead is white bold (not GradientText)"
