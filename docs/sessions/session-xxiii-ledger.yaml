decisions_made:
  - decision: "Rename 'Industries' to 'Verticals' including URL paths"
    rationale: "User directive — 'verticals' is more precise B2B SaaS positioning language. No live external links to break (no domain configured yet)."
    reversible: false
  - decision: "Keep internal type names (Industry, INDUSTRIES, industries-data.ts) unchanged"
    rationale: "Internal implementation detail — renaming types/files across dozens of imports adds churn with zero user-facing benefit."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Keep components/industries/ directory name unchanged"
    rationale: "Same as above — internal directory structure doesn't affect users or URLs."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Homepage capsules placed between CredibilitySection and CtaSection"
    rationale: "FAQ section reinforces credibility before final CTA — natural reading flow."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Services hub capsules placed between BridgeStatement and ServiceCTA"
    rationale: "After the narrative arc (hero→categories→AI→bridge), FAQ answers objections before CTA."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Verticals hub uses Sprinkles accent, Insights hub uses Tidal Wave accent"
    rationale: "Each hub gets a distinct brand color to differentiate sections visually."
    reversible: true

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs -> /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "Section is now called 'Verticals' not 'Industries' in all user-facing text"
  - "URLs are /verticals and /verticals/[slug] — old /industries routes removed"
  - "Internal types (Industry, INDUSTRIES, industries-data.ts) still use 'industry' naming"
  - "AnswerCapsule interface lives in lib/services-data.ts — single source of truth"
  - "Every answer capsule's first sentence must be a standalone quotable 20-25 word capsule"
  - "Hub page FAQ data lives in lib/schema/hub-faqs.ts"
  - "About page retains its own FAQ (AboutFaq component) — not replaced by AnswerCapsulesSection"
  - "Asteroids game is an easter egg — no navigation or docs pointing to it"
  - "Frogger game is an easter egg — Ocho trigger only, no navigation pointing to it"

next_actions:
  - "Build Contact page with form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"
  - "Build chatbot (chaDbot) — copy RAG from AEO"
  - "Create source monitors for B2B/AI marketing news"
