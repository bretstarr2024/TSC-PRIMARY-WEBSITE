commits:
  - hash: "9ee2cd4"
    message: "fix: Frogger game — DPI scaling, speed reduction, pill spacing, start screen"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/about/FroggerGame.tsx — Canvas DPI scaling (devicePixelRatio), speed reduction (~70%), pill gap tripled, start screen with title/instructions/pulsing CTA"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XIII entry added"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "devicePixelRatio canvas scaling for Retina clarity"
    rationale: "Canvas was rendering at 1x CSS pixels and being upscaled by browser on Retina displays, causing severe blur. Standard fix: render at native DPR, set CSS dimensions separately."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Base speed 0.35 (down from 1.2)"
    rationale: "Original speed was unplayable — pills moved too fast to navigate between. New speed provides a relaxed start with progressive challenge via level scaling."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Pill gaps tripled (pillH×4.5 + random×3)"
    rationale: "Original gaps (pillH×1.8 + random×1.2) left no navigable space between pills. Tripled gaps create clear lanes for player movement."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Start screen before gameplay"
    rationale: "Game launched directly into action with no context. Start screen shows title, Ocho icon, control instructions, and pulsing CTA. Pills drift slowly as visual backdrop. Any key or tap starts."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Frogger AABB collision detection uses simple box overlap — edge cases at very high levels"
    mitigation: "Player has invulnerability frames on respawn. Speed scaling is gradual. Playable well past level 10."
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "Pipeline infrastructure — moved to Session XIV"
  - "Industries page content"
  - "Contact page with form"
  - "Leadership headshot photos — still using generative avatars"

next_actions:
  - "Review Frogger on live site — verify DPI fix, speed, spacing, start screen"
  - "Build Industries page content (8 industry sub-pages from kernel ICP)"
  - "Build Contact page with form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"
  - "Add answer capsules to service pillar pages"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs -> /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "Asteroids game is an easter egg — no navigation or docs pointing to it"
  - "Frogger game is an easter egg — Ocho trigger only, no navigation pointing to it"
  - "Canvas games must use devicePixelRatio scaling for Retina displays"
