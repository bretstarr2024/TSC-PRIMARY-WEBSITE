    message: "feat: Add stub pages for About, Contact, Work, Industries, Careers + nav updates"

artifacts_updated:
  - "app/about/page.tsx — NEW: About stub page with metadata"
  - "app/contact/page.tsx — NEW: Contact stub page with metadata"
  - "app/work/page.tsx — NEW: Work stub page with metadata"
  - "app/industries/page.tsx — NEW: Industries stub page with metadata"
  - "app/careers/page.tsx — NEW: Careers stub page with metadata"
  - "components/Header.tsx — Added Work, Industries, About to nav links"
  - "components/Footer.tsx — Added About, Work, Industries, Careers, Contact to Company column"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session VI section added, Phase 3 stubs marked as pulled forward"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Header nav shows Services, Work, Industries, Insights, About (5 items + Let's Talk! CTA)"
    rationale: "Core agency sections visitors expect. Careers and Contact are secondary — footer only."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Footer Company column lists all 6 sections (About, Work, Industries, Insights, Careers, Contact)"
    rationale: "Footer is the comprehensive nav — include everything."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "All 5 stub pages use 'Coming soon' placeholder with consistent layout"
    rationale: "Content will be added in later sessions. Stubs establish routes and nav now."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "56 AI-generated content pieces have not been manually reviewed for quality"
    mitigation: "Spot-check a sample across content types on live site"
    severity: medium
  - risk: "Racheal's out-of-band commit (8d8894e) was not session-tracked"
    mitigation: "Documented in roadmap as out-of-band. Changes are substantial — review in future session if issues arise."
    severity: low
  - risk: "5 stub pages show 'Coming soon' — visible to visitors"
    mitigation: "Content will be added in upcoming sessions. Stubs are intentional placeholders."
    severity: low
