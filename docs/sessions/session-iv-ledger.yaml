decisions_made:
  - decision: "All CTAs site-wide link to Cal.com booking (cal.com/team/tsc/25-50)"
    rationale: "User directive — single conversion action, external booking page"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Removed fractional CMO content from generation pipeline"
    rationale: "User directive — no fractional CMO positioning for TSC"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Collapsed dual CTA buttons (primary + secondary) to single Let's Talk! button"
    rationale: "Both buttons would link to same Cal.com URL — redundant"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Removed Work, About, Contact nav links from Header and Footer"
    rationale: "Pages don't exist yet (Sessions XI-XII) — avoid 404s for visitors"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Custom 404 page features Melissa (internal joke/Easter egg)"
    rationale: "User directive — fun colleague recognition"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Homepage copy changes per colleague feedback (tagline, problem, approach)"
    rationale: "Internal review feedback — clearer value prop messaging"
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "56 AI-generated content pieces have not been manually reviewed for quality"
    mitigation: "Spot-check a sample across content types on live site"
    severity: medium
  - risk: "1 blog post rejected by forbidden term guardrail (synergy) — 'obstacles to building a growth engine' topic has no content"
    mitigation: "Could regenerate with stricter prompt or manually create"
    severity: low
  - risk: "Existing seed content still contains fractional CMO references (blog, FAQ, comparison, tool checklist)"
    mitigation: "Decide whether to purge seed data or leave as-is"
    severity: low
  - risk: "No pagination on listing pages — 102 pages with growing content volume"
    mitigation: "Add cursor-based pagination when any collection exceeds ~30 items"
    severity: low
  - risk: "Footer still lists 'Fractional CMO' in services column (links to valid service subpage)"
    mitigation: "Remove or rename when fractional CMO service decision is finalized"
    severity: low
