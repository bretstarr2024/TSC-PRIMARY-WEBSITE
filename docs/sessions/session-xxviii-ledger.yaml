decisions_made:
  - decision: "Game-to-page assignments: Pong/Contact, Snake/Insights, Space Invaders/Verticals, Galaga/Work, Pac-Man/Careers"
    rationale: "Thematic fit — Pong (back-and-forth conversation), Snake (consuming content/knowledge), Space Invaders (defending verticals), Galaga (capturing/delivering work), Pac-Man (navigating career path). All classic 70s-80s arcade games matching existing Asteroids/Frogger/Breakout/Tron vibe."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Client wrapper pattern for server component pages"
    rationale: "All 5 target pages export metadata (server components). Games need useState + dynamic. Wrapper isolates client logic so pages remain server components with metadata exports."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "All 5 games use full-screen portal pattern (not inline canvas)"
    rationale: "Consistent with 3 of 4 existing games (Asteroids, Breakout, Tron). Full viewport provides best gameplay experience."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Pac-Man maze hardcoded as string template — row length must be exactly 28 chars"
    mitigation: "Runtime padding/trimming in init function handles minor discrepancies. Verified at build time."
    severity: low
  - risk: "5 large game files (~6,300 lines total) are AI-generated and need gameplay testing"
    mitigation: "All follow verified patterns from existing games. Build passes. Manual browser testing recommended."
    severity: medium

explicitly_deferred:
  - "Contact page form with Resend integration — next session"
  - "Pipeline infrastructure from AEO — next session"
  - "Chatbot (chaDbot) — next session"
  - "Source monitors — next session"

next_actions:
  - "Test all 5 new games in browser — verify gameplay, SFX, high scores, boss overlay"
  - "Build Contact page form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"
  - "Build chatbot (chaDbot) — copy RAG from AEO"
  - "Create source monitors for B2B/AI marketing news"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs -> /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "Pricing page is DONE per user directive — no further changes unless requested"
  - "All game triggers use shared OchoTrigger component"
  - "Easter egg games are undocumented — no navigation or user-facing docs"
  - "Boss overlay z-index 100000 > game portals 99999 > custom cursor 9999"
  - "9 arcade games: Asteroids (homepage), Frogger (about), Breakout (services), Tron (pricing), Pong (contact), Snake (insights), Space Invaders (verticals), Galaga (work), Pac-Man (careers)"
  - "High score localStorage keys: tsc-{game}-scores (asteroids, frogger, breakout, tron, pong, snake, invaders, galaga, pacman)"
