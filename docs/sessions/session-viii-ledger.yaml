    message: "feat: Add Asteroids easter egg game to homepage hero"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/home/AsteroidsGame.tsx — NEW: Full canvas-based Asteroids game (ship, asteroids, bullets, particles, HUD, levels)"
  - "components/home/HeroSection.tsx — Replaced 'The Starr Conspiracy' pre-headline with clickable ship SVG + game launcher"
  - "components/about/OriginStory.tsx — Enhanced book section with Amazon link, newsletter CTA, 4.6-star rating, 3-col stats grid"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session VIII entry added"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Remove 'THE STARR CONSPIRACY' pre-headline from hero"
    rationale: "User said it's redundant — brand name already in header. Space used for ship easter egg."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Asteroids game lazy-loaded via next/dynamic"
    rationale: "Zero bundle cost until user clicks the ship — game code only loads on demand"
    reversible: false
  - decision: "Game uses brand colors (Tangerine ship, Tidal Wave asteroids, Neon Cactus score)"
    rationale: "Easter egg still reinforces brand identity"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Desktop keyboard-only controls (no touch)"
    rationale: "Easter egg — not a core feature. Touch controls would add complexity for minimal payoff."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Ship SVG may not be immediately recognized as clickable"
    mitigation: "Hover glow effect + 'click me' tooltip on hover provide discoverability hints"
    severity: low
  - risk: "Game overlay captures all keyboard input"
    mitigation: "ESC key always exits. Body scroll disabled while game is active."
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "Sound effects for Asteroids game — could add later if user wants"
  - "Mobile touch controls for game — desktop-only easter egg for now"
  - "High score persistence — could use localStorage later"
  - "Pipeline infrastructure — moved to Session IX"

next_actions:
  - "Play-test the Asteroids game and tune difficulty/feel"
  - "Add headshot images to leadership section when user provides photos"
  - "Build Industries page content (8 industry sub-pages from kernel ICP)"
  - "Build Contact page with form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs -> /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "Asteroids game is an easter egg — no navigation or docs pointing to it"
  - "Ship SVG replaces the pre-headline text (not added alongside it)"
