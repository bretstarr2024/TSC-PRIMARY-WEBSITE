    message: "docs: Update roadmap for Session XVI — marquee car teaser"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/about/ClientMarquee.tsx — Replaced pill badges with CarBadge component (CSS car shapes), added lane color system, direction-aware rendering"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XVI entry added"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "CSS car shapes in marquee matching Frogger drawCar aesthetic"
    rationale: "User loved the Frogger car obstacles and wanted them as a visual teaser in the client marquee. CSS implementation keeps it lightweight (no canvas needed for static display). Matches the game's boxy body, hood, windshield, wheels, headlights, taillights."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Row 1 tangerine, row 2 tidal lane colors"
    rationale: "Matches the first two Frogger lane colors. Direction-aware (left-moving = facing left, right-moving = facing right) creates a two-lane traffic feel that hints at the game."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "CarBadge has multiple absolute-positioned child elements per badge — 52 clients × 2 rows × 2 copies (doubled for loop) = 208 car instances in DOM"
    mitigation: "All elements are simple spans with inline styles — no JS animation, no layout thrashing. Framer Motion handles the single container translation. Performance should be fine."
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "Pipeline infrastructure — moved to Session XVII"
  - "Industries page content"
  - "Contact page with form"
  - "Leadership headshot photos — still using generative avatars"

next_actions:
  - "Verify car marquee on live site"
  - "Build Industries page content (8 industry sub-pages from kernel ICP)"
  - "Build Contact page with form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"
  - "Add answer capsules to service pillar pages"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs -> /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "Asteroids game is an easter egg — no navigation or docs pointing to it"
  - "Frogger game is an easter egg — Ocho trigger only, no navigation pointing to it"
  - "Canvas games must use devicePixelRatio scaling for Retina displays"
  - "All canvas input handlers must use logical (DPR-divided) coordinates"
  - "Frogger obstacles are cars (not pills) — drawCar function in FroggerGame.tsx"
  - "Client marquee uses CarBadge CSS cars matching Frogger aesthetic"
  - "Marquee lane colors: row 1 = tangerine, row 2 = tidal"
