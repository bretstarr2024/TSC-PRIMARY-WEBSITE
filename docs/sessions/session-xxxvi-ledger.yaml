decisions_made:
  - decision: "Fix homepage ArcadeButton by conditional rendering, not more CSS"
    rationale: "The bug was never a CSS specificity issue. The homepage was the only page that kept ArcadeButton in the DOM during gameplay. All 8 other pages already used conditional rendering. When the game closed on the homepage, browser focus returned to the still-mounted element, showing the focus indicator. Three sessions of CSS fixes (XXXIII-XXXV) targeted the shared component, which was identical across all pages — the wrong layer. Matching the conditional rendering pattern used everywhere else eliminates the focus-return entirely."
    reversible: true

explicitly_deferred:
  - "CoinSlotCTA page placement — next session"
  - "Expand Game Over concept to other pages — future sessions"
  - "Contact page form with Resend integration — next session"
  - "Pipeline infrastructure from AEO — next session"
  - "Chatbot (chaDbot) — future session"

next_actions:
  - "Verify homepage ArcadeButton no longer shows square box in production after playing Asteroids"
  - "Place CoinSlotCTA on homepage CTA section and/or other pages"
  - "Expand Game Over concept to other page headlines/sections"
  - "Build Contact page form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"

  - "Pricing page is DONE per user directive — no further changes unless requested"
  - "9 arcade games: all triggered by ArcadeButton (motion.div with role=button, real photo PNG)"
  - "Easter egg games are undocumented — no navigation or user-facing docs"
  - "ArcadeButton MUST be conditionally rendered with {!playing && ...} on EVERY page — never leave it mounted during gameplay"
  - "'Game Over' is the site's creative concept — first visible execution live on homepage hero"
