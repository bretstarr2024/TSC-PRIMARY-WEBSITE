artifacts_updated:
  - "components/home/ServicesSection.tsx — 6 granular items per service card (was 1-3)"
  - "components/home/AsteroidsGame.tsx — UFO random brand colors (6-color palette), full-height spawn range"
  - "components/services/ServicesHero.tsx — Rewritten to GradientText 'Services' + subhead pattern"
  - "components/industries/IndustriesHero.tsx — Rewritten to GradientText 'Verticals' + subhead pattern"
  - "components/about/AboutHero.tsx — Rewritten to GradientText 'About' + subhead pattern"
  - "components/pricing/PricingHero.tsx — Rewritten to GradientText 'Pricing' + subhead pattern"
  - "app/work/page.tsx — Subhead sizing matched (text-xl md:text-2xl + leading-relaxed)"
  - "components/services/ServiceDualUniverse.tsx — Inline strategicCapabilities, capability lists"
  - "lib/services-data.ts — 37 services total (30 strategic + 7 AI), all AEO-ready descriptions"
  - "components/services/BreakoutGame.tsx — START_PADDLE_W 150, DEPTH_SPEED_BONUS 0.6, paddle shrink per round"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XLIX complete, Session L upcoming"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "All page heroes use single GradientText word + descriptive subhead"
    rationale: "User liked the Insights page approach. Audit revealed 4 different patterns across 6 pages — inconsistency was unprofessional. Standardizing to simplest, most elegant pattern."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Each strategic service category expanded to 6 services"
    rationale: "GTM Kernel only defines category-level offerings. Inferred granular capabilities from B2B agency scope — user confirmed 'we do it all'. 6 per category provides visual density and completeness."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "ServiceDualUniverse uses inline capability arrays instead of services-data.ts imports"
    rationale: "The DualUniverse section shows capability names (not full service objects). Inline arrays are simpler and match homepage service cards exactly."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Breakout paddle starts at 150px (was 100)"
    rationale: "User directive — 100px felt too narrow at game start."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Breakout depth speed bonus 0.6 per row (was 0.3)"
    rationale: "User couldn't perceive the speed increase at 0.3. Doubling to 0.6 makes deepest-row hits add +3.6 total speed, which is clearly noticeable."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Asteroids UFOs appear in random brand colors"
    rationale: "Visual variance — 6-color palette from brand kit. Purely cosmetic, no gameplay impact."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Services page and Breakout game declared DONE by user"
    rationale: "User explicitly stated 'services page and breakout are DONE' after final tuning."
    reversible: false
  - decision: "Homepage declared DONE by user (mid-session)"
    rationale: "User stated 'we can call the homepage and the asteroids game DONE' after UFO fixes."
    reversible: false

known_risks:
  - risk: "37 services in services-data.ts — some may lack nuance without SME review"
    mitigation: "All descriptions follow kernel voice and AEO first-sentence pattern. Flag for Bret/JJ review."
    severity: low
  - risk: "Inline strategicCapabilities in both ServicesSection and ServiceDualUniverse may drift"
    mitigation: "Both currently match. If capabilities change, update both files."
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "Pipeline infrastructure from AEO — Session L"
  - "MongoDB index on leads collection (timestamp: -1) — Session L"
  - "Chatbot (chaDbot) deployment — future session"
  - "Expand Game Over concept to other page copy — future session"
  - "Vercel Analytics initialization — future session"
  - "SME review of expanded service descriptions — future session"

next_actions:
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO (lib/pipeline/*.ts)"
  - "Create MongoDB index on leads collection (timestamp: -1)"
  - "Expand Game Over concept to other page copy/headlines"
  - "Build chatbot (chaDbot) — copy RAG from AEO"
  - "Initialize Vercel Analytics"
  - "Have SMEs (Bret/JJ/Racheal) review expanded service descriptions for accuracy"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "Homepage hero: flex items-center justify-center (NOT flex-col)"
  - "All page heroes use GradientText single-word headline + subhead pattern"
  - "Services page is DONE per user directive — no further changes unless requested"
  - "Homepage is DONE per user directive — no further changes unless requested"
  - "Breakout game is DONE per user directive"
  - "Pricing page is DONE per user directive"
  - "ServiceDualUniverse and ServicesSection share same capability lists — keep in sync"
  - "All general CTAs -> /contact; service-specific CTAs -> /book"
  - "9 arcade games: all triggered by ArcadeButton (motion.div with role=button)"
  - "Game Over is the site's creative concept"
