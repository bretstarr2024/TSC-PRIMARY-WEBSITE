artifacts_updated:
  - "components/about/LeadershipSection.tsx — Replaced gradient initials with GenerativeAvatar SVG component (nameHash, PRNG, orbital animation)"
  - "components/about/OriginStory.tsx — Stats: 100+ Brands repositioned → 1,000+ Shots of tequila; Book ratings: 45 → 451"
  - "components/home/CredibilitySection.tsx — Stats: 150M+ → 500M+ Defining moments, 1000+ → 3000+"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XI entry added"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Generative orbital SVG avatars instead of gradient initials"
    rationale: "AI-native aesthetic — each leader gets a unique animated emblem with counter-rotating elliptical orbits, pulsing core, and ambient spark. Deterministic via name-seeded PRNG so the same person always gets the same avatar. Pure SVG animation (animateTransform, animate) — no JS animation loop, GPU-friendly."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Brand color pairs for avatar palette"
    rationale: "10 unique [primary, secondary] color pairs from brand palette (Tangerine, Cactus, Tidal, Sprinkles). Each leader gets a distinct combination. Colors used for orbital rings, dots, glow, and core."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Removed initials field from Leader interface and data"
    rationale: "No longer rendered. Dead code removed per project convention."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "'1,000+ Shots of tequila' stat"
    rationale: "User directive — replaces '100+ Brands repositioned' with irreverent brand personality stat. Aligns with Sage + Rebel archetype."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "SVG animateTransform may render differently across browsers"
    mitigation: "Uses only basic rotate type and animate elements — universally supported. No SMIL-specific features that are deprecated."
    severity: low
  - risk: "10 simultaneously animated SVG avatars could cause jank on low-end devices"
    mitigation: "Each avatar has only 4 animated elements (2 rotating groups + 1 pulsing circle + 1 fading spark). SVG animations are compositor-level, not main-thread JS."
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "Pipeline infrastructure — moved to Session XII"
  - "Industries page content"
  - "Contact page with form"
  - "Leadership headshot photos — still using generative avatars (upgrade when photos available)"

next_actions:
  - "Review generative avatars on live site — verify animation smoothness and visual appeal"
  - "Add headshot images to leadership section when user provides photos"
  - "Build Industries page content (8 industry sub-pages from kernel ICP)"
  - "Build Contact page with form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs -> /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "Asteroids game is an easter egg — no navigation or docs pointing to it"
  - "GenerativeAvatar uses nameHash + PRNG for deterministic per-person uniqueness"
  - "Avatar palette has 10 brand color pairs — if leaders change, palette still works (index % 10)"
  - "Stats on About page: Founded 1999, 3,000+ B2B tech clients, 1,000+ Shots of tequila"
  - "Book ratings: 451 on Amazon"
