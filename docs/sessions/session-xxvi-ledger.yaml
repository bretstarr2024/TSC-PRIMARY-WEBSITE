artifacts_updated:
  - "components/pricing/TronGame.tsx — Visual overhaul: CELL 4→8, blue-black bg (#05080f), major/minor grid lines, neon border with shadowBlur 15, 3-layer trail rendering (outer glow + core + white center line), directional arrow/chevron light cycle sprites with rotation, radial vignette, bigger sparks. Cursor fix via isOver state + data-attribute CSS."
  - "components/ArcadeBossOverlay.tsx — data-arcade-boss attribute + CSS rules restoring cursor: default, pointer on buttons, text on inputs (all !important to override global cursor: none)"
  - "components/home/AsteroidsGame.tsx — isOver state + data-asteroids-game attribute + conditional style tag for cursor on game-over"
  - "components/services/BreakoutGame.tsx — isOver state + data-breakout-game attribute + conditional style tag for cursor on game-over"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XXVI entry, next session renumbered to XXVII"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "CELL increased from 4 to 8 for Tron game"
    rationale: "4px cells made trails and cycles nearly invisible. 8px provides visible game elements while keeping 240×135 grid cells on 1920×1080 — plenty of gameplay space. Game feels faster visually, matching the original arcade pace."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Light cycles rendered as directional arrow/chevron shapes instead of circles"
    rationale: "Classic Tron arcade shows actual vehicle shapes with directional orientation. Arrows convey movement direction and look more like light cycles than plain dots."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "3-layer trail rendering (outer glow + core + white center line)"
    rationale: "Matches the neon light-pipe aesthetic of the Tron franchise. Single-layer trails lacked the bloom/glow effect that defines the visual identity."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Cursor fix uses data-attribute CSS selectors with !important to override global cursor: none"
    rationale: "CustomCursor.tsx sets `* { cursor: none !important; }` globally. Game portals at z-99999 are above the custom cursor at z-9999. Using [data-X-game] selectors with !important provides higher specificity than the global * rule. Alternative of bumping CustomCursor z-index was rejected to avoid showing the custom cursor dot during active gameplay."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Frogger game not modified for cursor fix"
    rationale: "Frogger uses an inline canvas (z-30) not a portal (z-99999), so the custom cursor at z-9999 is already visible above it. No fix needed."
    reversible: false

known_risks:
  - risk: "CELL=8 makes game visually faster (each tick covers 8px instead of 4px)"
    mitigation: "This is intentional — matches the fast-paced feel of the original arcade. TICK_MS kept at 50ms. If too fast, increase TICK_MS."
    severity: low
  - risk: "Inline <style> tags injected on game-over could theoretically conflict with other global CSS"
    mitigation: "Using scoped data-attribute selectors ([data-tron-game], etc.) ensures they only target the specific game portal div and its descendants."
    severity: low
