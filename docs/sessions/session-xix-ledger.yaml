    message: "feat: Add thruster flame, exhaust sparks, and game-like micro-turns to hero ship"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/home/HeroSection.tsx — Two-layer thruster flame (outer orange gradient + inner white-hot core), 3 exhaust spark particles, game-like -4°/+3.5° micro-turns synced to thruster bursts via coordinated keyframe times arrays on 8s cycle"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XIX entry added"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Thruster bursts synced to rotation via coordinated keyframe times arrays"
    rationale: "Coordinating thruster firing with ship turns sells the illusion of active maneuvering. Looks intentional rather than random."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "8-second animation cycle with two burn/turn sequences"
    rationale: "Long enough to feel organic, short enough to see the full behavior quickly. Two turns per cycle (left then right) prevents visual monotony."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Exhaust sparks on staggered independent timings (not perfectly synced to burns)"
    rationale: "Perfect sync would look mechanical. Slight timing drift creates organic randomness while sparks still roughly coincide with burns."
    reversible: true
