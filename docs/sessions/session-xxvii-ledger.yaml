artifacts_updated:
  - "components/pricing/PricingCards.tsx — Removed 'Most Popular' and 'Defined Scope' badge pills. Changed 'Starting at' to 'minimum'. Updated subscription checklist (Strategic planning, Opportunity prioritization, Traditional agency services, AI workflows and custom builds). CTA buttons now 'Let's talk about a subscription/project' with ?service= param passthrough to /book. Flex-col layout for equal card heights."
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XXVII entry, next session renumbered to XXVIII"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Remove badge pills from pricing cards entirely"
    rationale: "User directive: 'We don't need to justify it.' No badge on either card — clean, confident presentation."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "CTA buttons say 'Let's talk about a subscription/project' instead of generic 'Let's Talk!'"
    rationale: "User directive: specific CTA copy that passes context to the booking page. ?service= param flows into Cal.com embed notes field."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Subscription checklist updated to: Dedicated senior team, Strategic planning, Opportunity prioritization, Traditional agency services, AI workflows and custom builds"
    rationale: "User directive: more specific service description replacing generic items like 'Continuous context accumulation' and 'Iterative improvement over time'."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Pricing page declared 'done' by user"
    rationale: "User stated 'We can call the pricing page done after those fixes.'"
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Cal.com ?notes= parameter may truncate long service context strings"
    mitigation: "Current values are single words ('Subscription', 'Project') — no risk. Monitor if service-page CTAs pass longer strings."
    severity: low
