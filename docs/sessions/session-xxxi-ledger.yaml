artifacts_updated:
  - "components/CoinSlotCTA.tsx — NEW: Arcade coin slot CTA button with metallic frame, corner screws, recessed LED display, '25¢' / 'PUSH' in Press Start 2P with multi-layer LED glow, idle pulse/flicker animation, spring press-in on click, links to /book by default."
  - "components/ArcadeButton.tsx — NEW: Classic 1-Player arcade cabinet button. Dark metallic bezel housing, concave Atomic Tangerine button face with radial gradient, white stick figure SVG icon, idle bob animation, hover glow, press-in depression."
  - "app/layout.tsx — Added Press Start 2P font import from next/font/google, --font-arcade CSS variable."
  - "tailwind.config.ts — Added font-arcade family to theme.extend.fontFamily."
  - "components/OchoTrigger.tsx — DELETED: replaced by ArcadeButton across all 9 game triggers."
  - "9 game trigger files — Swapped OchoTrigger → ArcadeButton import and usage (HeroSection, ClientMarquee, BridgeStatement, WhyDifferent, PongGameTrigger, PacManGameTrigger, SnakeGameTrigger, SpaceInvadersGameTrigger, GalagaGameTrigger)."
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XXXI entry, next session renumbered to XXXII."

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Adopt 'Game Over' concept as site-wide creative theme"
    rationale: "Traditional B2B marketing model is dead — 'Game Over' frames TSC's positioning (Sage + Rebel archetype). Arcade games already built on every page make this concept organic rather than forced. The metaphor maps to all aspects of the offering (Level Up, Power-Ups, Boss Battles, etc.)."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Replace OchoTrigger with 1-Player arcade cabinet button"
    rationale: "User wanted easter eggs to be slightly more visible and on-theme with the Game Over concept. Classic arcade 1-Player button is universally recognizable from real cabinets. Atomic Tangerine button with white stick figure matches brand standards."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "CoinSlotCTA uses 'PUSH' not 'PUSH TO REJECT'"
    rationale: "User flagged 'push to reject' is confusing for a CTA — sounds like rejection. 'PUSH' is clean and action-oriented."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Added Press Start 2P as arcade font"
    rationale: "Inter (the site font) can't sell the LED/pixel display look no matter how much glow you add. Press Start 2P is the canonical arcade pixel font. Loaded via next/font/google (self-hosted, ~6KB). Only used inside CoinSlotCTA — zero impact on other pages."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "CoinSlotCTA not placed on any page yet"
    rationale: "Component created as a reusable file. Placement will happen when the 'Game Over' concept is applied to homepage copy and CTA sections."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "ArcadeButton 1-Player stick figure might be confused with a bathroom sign"
    mitigation: "Component renders the full physical button (bezel housing + concave face + icon) not just the icon. The 3D button context makes it clearly an arcade button. Verify in browser."
    severity: low
  - risk: "CoinSlotCTA not yet placed on any page — could be forgotten"
    mitigation: "Recorded in next_actions and roadmap Session XXXII items."
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "CoinSlotCTA page placement — next session when homepage copy is reframed for Game Over concept"
  - "Homepage copy reframe for Game Over concept — next session"
  - "Selective retro visual touches (CRT scanlines, pixel dividers) — future session"
  - "Contact page form with Resend integration — next session"
  - "Pipeline infrastructure from AEO — next session"
  - "Chatbot (chaDbot) — next session"
  - "Source monitors — next session"

next_actions:
  - "Test ArcadeButton in browser on all 9 pages (verify 1-Player button renders correctly)"
  - "Test CoinSlotCTA by temporarily placing on a page (verify LED glow, press animation, font)"
  - "Place CoinSlotCTA on homepage and/or CTA sections"
  - "Reframe homepage copy for Game Over concept"
  - "Build Contact page form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"
  - "Build chatbot (chaDbot) — copy RAG from AEO"
