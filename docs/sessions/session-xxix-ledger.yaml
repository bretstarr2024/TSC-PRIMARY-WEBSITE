    message: "docs: Session XXIX roadmap update — arcade game enhancements"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/industries/SpaceInvadersGame.tsx — Classic arcade visual overhaul (navy CRT bg, Neon Cactus shields with glow, ground line), Ocho mascot commander row, reduced UFO frequency (all 4 timer reset points fixed)"
  - "components/home/AsteroidsGame.tsx — Drawn classic saucer UFO replacing Ocho image, sawtooth hum matching Space Invaders, removed unused image loading code"
  - "components/insights/SnakeGame.tsx — Multi-food system (3 regular + bonus diamond + golden star), combo system (up to x6), eat sparks, floating score text, food blink on expiry, new SFX"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XXIX entry, next session renumbered to XXX"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Standardize UFOs to drawn classic saucer across all games"
    rationale: "User loved the Space Invaders UFO and wanted it consistent. Drawn saucer with sawtooth hum replaces Ocho image UFO in Asteroids."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Ocho mascot renders as commander row (type 0) in Space Invaders"
    rationale: "User wanted Ocho in the invader formation. Commander row is the top row, most visible and last to be shot."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Snake multi-food with combo system"
    rationale: "User found single-dot Snake 'missing the point'. 3 regular foods + timed bonus/golden items with combo multipliers add arcade excitement."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Reduce UFO frequency by ~2.4x (timer base 500→1200)"
    rationale: "User said 'too many UFOs'. Timer now 1200 + random*1200 (was 500 + random*500) across all 4 reset points."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Game enhancements are AI-generated and need gameplay testing in browser"
    mitigation: "All follow verified patterns from existing game code. Build passes. Manual browser testing recommended."
    severity: medium

next_actions:
