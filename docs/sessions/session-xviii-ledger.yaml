    message: "docs: Update roadmap for Session XVIII — homepage ship SVG fix"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/home/HeroSection.tsx — Ship SVG path replaced (6-point → 4-point game shape), animation enhanced (float + rotation + ambient glow)"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XVIII entry added"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Ship SVG uses exact game ship proportions rotated 90° to point downward"
    rationale: "User wanted the homepage ship to match the actual Asteroids game ship exactly. Game ship vertices (nose, wings, rear notch) converted from canvas coordinates to SVG path."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Subtle animation: ±6px float + ±2° rotation on 4s cycle with ambient glow"
    rationale: "User requested subtle movement to draw attention without being distracting. Gentle float + rotation creates a 'breathing' effect."
    reversible: true
