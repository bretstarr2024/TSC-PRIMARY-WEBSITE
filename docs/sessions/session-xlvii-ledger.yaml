    message: "fix: Restore hero layout — center text in sphere, widen subhead, position button"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/home/HeroSection.tsx — Restored flex items-center justify-center centering; subhead max-w back to 600px; ArcadeButton at absolute bottom-[20vh]"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XLVII added, Session XLVIII upcoming"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Restore flex items-center justify-center for hero section centering"
    rationale: "The flex-col + flex-1 spacer approach (d50ca54, 0b5bead) broke text centering in the sphere. The original CSS centering perfectly aligns the text block with the Three.js sphere because both are centered in the viewport."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "ArcadeButton at absolute bottom-[20vh] instead of bottom-8 or flex spacer"
    rationale: "bottom-8 (32px) was too close to the section edge. The flex spacer approach broke centering. bottom-[20vh] places the button at ~80% from top — approximately halfway between sphere bottom (~60%) and section bottom (100%)."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Subhead max-width restored to 600px from 480px"
    rationale: "480px made the text wrap excessively and appear cramped. 600px was the original value from Session XXXIX's spatial refinement commit."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "ArcadeButton bottom-[20vh] is a viewport-relative estimate — may not look perfectly centered on all screen sizes"
    mitigation: "User should verify on deploy; easy to tweak the vh value"
    severity: low
