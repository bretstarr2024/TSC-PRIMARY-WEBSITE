decisions_made:
  - decision: "Leadership section framed as 'Leadership' not 'Team'"
    rationale: "User requested positioning to imply a larger organization behind the listed leaders"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "52 clients highlighted from 500+ CRM list"
    rationale: "Curated for brand recognition, scale, and 'wow factor' — mix of enterprise giants, major HR tech, and high-growth startups"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Stats claim '3,000+ B2B tech companies since 1999 (and counting)'"
    rationale: "User-provided number representing total client relationships over 25+ years"
    reversible: false
  - decision: "FAQ schema lives in lib/schema/about-faq.ts (not in client component)"
    rationale: "Server-rendered JSON-LD requires server-accessible module — client components can't export functions for SSR"
    reversible: false
  - decision: "Reuse ServiceCTA component for About page CTA"
    rationale: "Consistent conversion pattern, no need for custom CTA"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Bret's bio excludes WorkEasy Software mention and book publisher"
    rationale: "User directive — keep focus on TSC"
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Leadership bios are hardcoded in LeadershipSection.tsx"
    mitigation: "Move to kernel config or CMS when team changes — currently 10 people with stable roles"
    severity: low
  - risk: "Client names are hardcoded in ClientMarquee.tsx"
    mitigation: "Easy to update as needed — consider CMS or kernel integration later"
    severity: low
  - risk: "No headshot images — using gradient initials avatars"
    mitigation: "Can add photos later when available — component structure supports it"
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "AI partnership credentials section — user to clarify which are formal partnerships vs API usage tiers"
  - "Team headshot photos — designing around text-only for now"
  - "Industries page content — stub only"
  - "Work page content — stub only (lowest priority per user)"
  - "Contact page content — stub only"
  - "Careers page content — stub only"
  - "Pipeline infrastructure — moved to Session VIII"

next_actions:
  - "Add headshot images to leadership section when user provides photos"
  - "Clarify and add AI partnership credentials section"
  - "Build Industries page content (8 industry sub-pages from kernel ICP)"
  - "Build Contact page with form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs → /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "Leadership section labeled 'Leadership' (not 'Team')"
  - "Stats: 3,000+ B2B tech clients since 1999"
  - "Bret bio: no WorkEasy Software, no book publisher name"
  - "FAQ schema must live in server-accessible module (lib/schema/), not in use-client components"
