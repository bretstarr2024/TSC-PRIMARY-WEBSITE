    message: "docs: Session XXXIV roadmap update — GAME OVER hero + ArcadeButton fix"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/ArcadeButton.tsx — Switched from motion.button to motion.div with role='button'; added unoptimized to Image"
  - "components/home/HeroSection.tsx — Complete hero rewrite: GAME OVER headline in Press Start 2P, LED glow, CRT flicker, scanline overlay, new sub-headline with GradientText 'level up'"
  - "app/globals.css — Added .crt-scanlines reusable CSS utility"
  - "app/layout.tsx — Updated OG title to 'Game Over for Traditional B2B Marketing'"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XXXIV entry, next session renumbered to XXXV"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Switch ArcadeButton from <motion.button> to <motion.div> with role='button'"
    rationale: "Browser default button styling (background, border, padding) was creating a visible square that CSS overrides couldn't fully eliminate, likely due to Framer Motion style merging. A div with button semantics avoids the issue entirely. Acceptable since this is a hidden easter egg trigger."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Use Press Start 2P with -webkit-font-smoothing: none for GAME OVER headline"
    rationale: "Crisp pixel rendering is more authentic to 80s arcade screens. Aliased rendering of pixel fonts looks MORE retro on Retina displays."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "GAME and OVER stacked vertically (not on one line)"
    rationale: "This is how arcade screens actually displayed it. Also solves responsive overflow — Press Start 2P has much wider characters than Inter."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Sub-headline copy: user-provided 'The SaaS marketing era is over...' with 'level up' in GradientText"
    rationale: "User directive. Gaming vocabulary ('level up') ties the sub-headline to the GAME OVER concept visually and semantically."
    reversible: true

explicitly_deferred:
  - "CoinSlotCTA page placement — next session, now that GAME OVER concept is live on homepage"
  - "Expand Game Over concept to other pages (services, pricing, etc.) — future sessions"
  - "Contact page form with Resend integration — next session"
  - "Pipeline infrastructure from AEO — next session"
  - "Chatbot (chaDbot) — future session"

next_actions:
  - "Verify GAME OVER hero renders correctly in production (glow, flicker, scanlines, responsive)"
  - "Verify ArcadeButton no longer shows square box (the original issue)"
  - "Place CoinSlotCTA on homepage CTA section and/or other pages"
  - "Expand Game Over concept to other page headlines/sections"
  - "Build Contact page form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs -> /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "Pricing page is DONE per user directive — no further changes unless requested"
  - "9 arcade games: all triggered by ArcadeButton (motion.div with role=button, real photo PNG)"
  - "Easter egg games are undocumented — no navigation or user-facing docs"
  - "ArcadeButton uses /images/1_player.png (transparent PNG, unoptimized, via next/image)"
  - "'Game Over' is the site's creative concept — first visible execution now live on homepage hero"
  - ".crt-scanlines CSS utility is reusable for future Game Over concept expansion across site"
  - "Press Start 2P font available as font-arcade Tailwind class (CSS var --font-arcade)"
  - "LED glow pattern: 5-layer textShadow with #FF7A40 text color and #FF5910 glow (shared with CoinSlotCTA)"
