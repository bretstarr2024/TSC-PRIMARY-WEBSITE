commits:

    message: "feat: Tune Galaga firing — 10-bullet cap with fast cooldown"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/work/GalagaGame.tsx — Removed MAX_BULLETS constant (was 3/6), replaced with inline 10-bullet cap. Cooldown 7→3 frames."

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Galaga firing: 10 bullets on screen, 3-frame cooldown"
    rationale: "User tested unlimited ammo first — too much. 10-bullet cap with fast cooldown gives satisfying mashing without flooding the screen."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Galaga game declared DONE"
    rationale: "User tested and confirmed 'It's perfect. We can call galaga done.'"
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Game loop uses requestAnimationFrame without delta-time normalization"
    mitigation: "Works correctly on 60Hz displays. On 120Hz displays game runs 2x fast. All 9 games share this pattern — would need a global fix."
    severity: low
