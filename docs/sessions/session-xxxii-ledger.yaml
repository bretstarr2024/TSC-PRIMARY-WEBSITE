    message: "docs: Session XXXII roadmap update — ArcadeButton photo upgrade"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/ArcadeButton.tsx — Rewritten: replaced CSS-gradient circle + inline SVG stick figure with real 3D arcade button photo via next/image. Removed PlayerIcon component. Hover glow now uses drop-shadow filter."
  - "public/images/1_player.png — NEW: 25KB transparent PNG of real arcade 1-Player button (128×128, exported from Canva with BG removed)."
  - "public/images/1_player.svg — DELETED: 158KB raster-data-in-SVG wrapper, replaced by optimized PNG."
  - "public/images/1_player_backup.svg — DELETED: temporary backup from optimization attempt."
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XXXII entry added, next session renumbered to XXXIII."

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Use real photo of arcade button instead of CSS-gradient recreation"
    rationale: "User provided a 3D arcade button image from Canva. Real photo looks more authentic and recognizable than CSS approximation. Transparent PNG at 128×128 (25KB) is small enough for a lazy-loaded easter egg trigger."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Export at 128×128 with transparent background"
    rationale: "Button displays at 54-64px on screen. 128px is 2× retina. Transparent background lets it sit cleanly on dark page backgrounds. Reduced file from 158KB SVG to 25KB PNG."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Use next/image instead of raw img tag"
    rationale: "Next.js image optimization provides lazy loading, srcset generation, and format conversion automatically."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Hover glow via CSS drop-shadow filter instead of boxShadow"
    rationale: "boxShadow renders a rectangular shadow on transparent PNGs. drop-shadow filter follows the image's alpha contour, producing a proper glow around the circular button shape."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Photo-based button may look slightly different across screen DPIs"
    mitigation: "128×128 source is 2× retina for the 64px display size. next/image handles srcset. Monitor on actual devices."
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "CoinSlotCTA page placement — next session when homepage copy is reframed for Game Over concept"
  - "Homepage copy reframe for Game Over concept — next session"
  - "Selective retro visual touches (CRT scanlines, pixel dividers) — future session"
  - "Contact page form with Resend integration — next session"
  - "Pipeline infrastructure from AEO — next session"
  - "Chatbot (chaDbot) — next session"
  - "Source monitors — next session"

next_actions:
  - "Test ArcadeButton photo in browser on all 9 pages (verify PNG renders correctly at 64px with hover glow)"
  - "Place CoinSlotCTA on homepage and/or CTA sections"
  - "Reframe homepage copy for Game Over concept"
  - "Build Contact page form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"
  - "Build chatbot (chaDbot) — copy RAG from AEO"
