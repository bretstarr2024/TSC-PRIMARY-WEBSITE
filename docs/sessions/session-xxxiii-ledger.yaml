    message: "docs: Session XXXIII roadmap update — ArcadeButton focus outline fix"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/ArcadeButton.tsx — Added focus:outline-none, focus-visible:outline-none, focus:ring-0, focus-visible:ring-0 to suppress browser focus box after game exit."
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XXXIII entry added, next session renumbered to XXXIV."

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Suppress all focus indicators on ArcadeButton"
    rationale: "Easter egg trigger button doesn't need accessibility focus ring — it's a hidden game trigger, not a form element. The focus box was visually jarring after exiting games."
    reversible: true

  - "Place CoinSlotCTA on homepage and/or CTA sections"
  - "Reframe homepage copy for Game Over concept"
  - "Build Contact page form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"

  - "Easter egg games are undocumented — no navigation or user-facing docs"
  - "ArcadeButton uses /images/1_player.png (transparent PNG via next/image)"
  - "'Game Over' is the emerging site concept — traditional B2B marketing is dead, time to level up"
