    message: "feat: Add Tron light cycle game to pricing page easter egg"
  - hash: "59177df"
    message: "docs: Session XXV roadmap update — Tron light cycle game on pricing page"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/pricing/TronGame.tsx — New Tron light cycle game (player vs AI, neon grid, trail collision, SFX, high scores, boss overlay, touch D-pad)"
  - "components/pricing/WhyDifferent.tsx — Added game state, dynamic import TronGame, OchoTrigger below The Combination card"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XXV entry, next session renumbered to XXVI"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Tron game placed in WhyDifferent section on pricing page (below The Combination card)"
    rationale: "Follows the same pattern as Breakout in BridgeStatement — OchoTrigger after a statement section. Natural narrative beat between philosophy and pricing."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Game over text is 'DERESOLVED' (not 'GAME OVER')"
    rationale: "Tron film vocabulary — adds flavor and distinguishes this game from the others."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Scoring: +1 per tick survived, +100 × level per enemy killed"
    rationale: "Survival score rewards longevity, enemy kills reward aggression. Level multiplier incentivizes progressing."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "3-2-1 countdown before each round"
    rationale: "Tron races start with a countdown. Gives player orientation time before movement begins."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "AI enemies pathfind toward player with random turn chance, die when fully trapped"
    rationale: "Simple but effective AI. Trapped enemies dying rewards strategic play (boxing them in)."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Continuous engine hum SFX (low sawtooth) during gameplay"
    rationale: "Tron light cycles are defined by their engine sound. Adds immersion."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Levels add enemies: 1→2→3→4 max"
    rationale: "Progressive difficulty without overwhelming. 4 enemies on screen is plenty intense."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "isOccupied() checks all trail points every tick — O(n) per cycle where n = trail length"
    mitigation: "Grid is finite (screen pixels / 4), games rarely exceed a few hundred ticks. Performance is fine on modern hardware. Could optimize with Set-based lookup if needed."
    severity: low
  - risk: "Enemy AI can occasionally trap itself quickly on small screens"
    mitigation: "This is intentional gameplay — trapping enemies earns points. Small screens have proportionally smaller grids."
    severity: low

next_actions:
