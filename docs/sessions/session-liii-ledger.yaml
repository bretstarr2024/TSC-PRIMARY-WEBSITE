deployment:
  platform: vercel

  environment: production

  status: "not modified"
  notes: "Arcade boss API adds email sending but no new MongoDB fields — same document schema as before."

commits:
  - hash: "0656949"
    message: "feat: Space Invaders overhaul + arcade boss email notifications"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/industries/SpaceInvadersGame.tsx — Complete overhaul: authentic 1978 mechanics (speed curve, UFO scoring table, 3 shot types, shield persistence, enhanced explosions, march tempo sync)"
  - "app/api/arcade-boss/route.ts — Added dual Resend email notifications (team alert + winner auto-reply) for all 9 arcade games"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session LIII completed, Session LIV upcoming section added"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Space Invaders declared DONE by user"
    rationale: "User tested and said 'space invaders is great. Let's call it done.'"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "10 player bullets on screen with 8-frame cooldown"
    rationale: "User rejected single-bullet authentic mode ('one bullet at a time is not enough. let's do 10'). 10 bullets with fast cooldown feels generous and fun."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "20px enemy drop distance, faster speed curve"
    rationale: "User said 'they are slow as fuck' and 'don't drop far enough'. Reduced base intervals by ~33% and increased drop from 12→20px."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Arcade boss emails go to LEAD_RECIPIENTS list"
    rationale: "User wants the whole team notified when someone claims #1 high score. Reuses existing Resend infrastructure and env vars."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Vertical detail pages declared DONE by user before session started"
    rationale: "User said carry-forward item 1 is done — moved directly to Space Invaders testing."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Arcade boss emails only work in production (requires RESEND_API_KEY + LEAD_RECIPIENTS)"
    mitigation: "Graceful degradation — MongoDB write succeeds even if email fails. No local testing possible without env vars."
    severity: low
  - risk: "HTML entity in email subject line (&#x1F3C6;) may not render as emoji in all email clients"
    mitigation: "Falls back to entity display. Non-critical — subject line text is still clear without the emoji."
    severity: low
  - risk: "Game loop uses requestAnimationFrame without delta-time normalization"
    mitigation: "Works correctly on 60Hz displays. On 120Hz displays game runs 2x fast. All 9 games share this pattern."
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "Pipeline infrastructure from AEO — Session LIV"
  - "MongoDB index on leads collection (timestamp: -1) — Session LIV"
  - "Chatbot (chaDbot) deployment — Session LIV+"
  - "Vercel Analytics initialization — future session"
  - "Delta-time normalization for all arcade games — future session"

next_actions:
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO (lib/pipeline/*.ts)"
  - "Create MongoDB index on leads collection (timestamp: -1)"
  - "Build chatbot (chaDbot) — copy RAG from AEO"
  - "Initialize Vercel Analytics"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "Homepage, Services, Pricing, all 9 arcade games — DONE per user directive"
  - "Verticals hub page + detail pages DONE per user directive"
  - "Space Invaders DONE per user directive"
  - "All page heroes use GradientText single-word headline + subhead pattern"
  - "All general CTAs -> /contact; service-specific CTAs -> /book"
  - "15 verticals: 10 HR Tech sub-verticals + 5 adjacent (no DevTools, Cloud Infra, AI/ML)"
  - "Arcade boss emails: team notification + winner auto-reply via Resend (all 9 games)"
  - "Footer: Contact lives under Connect, not Company"
