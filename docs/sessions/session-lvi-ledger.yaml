decisions_made:
  - decision: "Chatbot (chaDbot) permanently dropped from scope"
    rationale: "Zero AEO value (AI models don't crawl chatbot responses), no differentiation (every agency has one), conversion funnel pressure release valve. The autonomous content pipeline is the real AI differentiator."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Careers roles are fabricated"
    rationale: "User directive — AI Workflow Engineer and Senior B2B Marketing Strategist are aspirational/representational, not actual open positions."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Careers form reuses existing lead API with source='careers'"
    rationale: "No need for separate application system. Submissions go to same LEAD_RECIPIENTS. Source field distinguishes career inquiries from contact leads."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "First production cron runs still not observed"
    mitigation: "Check pipeline_logs collection after 8am UTC to verify cron execution"
    severity: medium
  - risk: "Content prompt forbidden term rejection rate may still be high"
    mitigation: "Monitor pipeline_logs for quality check failures, tune prompts further if needed"
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "Work page — last remaining stub, needs case study content (real or fabricated)"
  - "Pipeline monitoring — check if production crons have actually fired"
  - "Domain configuration — still on vercel.app"
  - "OG images / social cards — none yet"
  - "Video pipeline — Phase 4, untouched"

next_actions:
  - "Monitor first production cron runs — check pipeline_logs after 8am UTC"
  - "Build Work page — case study showcase (needs content direction from user)"
  - "Configure production domain when ready"
  - "Tune content prompts further if forbidden term rejection rate stays high"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All API clients use pure fetch — no SDK dependencies"
  - "Insights section display name is now Grist — URLs stay at /insights/*"
  - "11 content types: blog, faq, glossary, comparison, expert-qa, news, case_study, industry_brief, video, tool, infographic"
  - "Pipeline daily budget: $5/day, per-type caps in content-guardrails.ts"
  - "Cron auth: Bearer token via CRON_SECRET env var"
  - "pipeline_logs TTL: 30 days auto-expiry"
  - "No fractional CMO content in generation pipeline"
  - "No chatbot — dropped from scope Session LVI"
  - "Careers form submissions use source='careers', ctaId='careers-form' via existing /api/lead"
