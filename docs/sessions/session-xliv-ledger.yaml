    message: "feat: Smooth hero-to-content transition — starfield fade + section overlap"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/home/HeroSection.tsx — Added h-64 bottom gradient overlay (transparent → #141213) to dissolve starfield; scroll indicator z-10"
  - "components/home/WhoWeAreSection.tsx — Negative margin (-mt-20 md:-mt-28) to overlap fading starfield; z-10 for layering; split py into explicit pt/pb"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XLIV added, status updated, Session XLV upcoming"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Hero bottom fade uses h-64 (16rem) gradient from transparent to #141213"
    rationale: "Long enough to create a smooth dissolve but not so tall that it obscures hero content. Matches the Heart of Darkness background color exactly."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "WhoWeAreSection overlaps hero by -mt-20 (5rem) / md:-mt-28 (7rem)"
    rationale: "User requested ~20% gap reduction. This pulls content into the fade zone, creating a layered transition instead of a hard stop."
    reversible: true
