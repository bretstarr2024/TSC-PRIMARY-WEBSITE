decisions_made:
  - decision: "Pricing page structured as 6-section narrative arc, not just a pricing table"
    rationale: "The agency model brief tells a story (premise → inversion → pillars → synthesis → pricing). A narrative page sells the value before showing the price. Matches the creative mandate."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Subscription card marked 'Most Popular' with tangerine accent, project card has neutral styling"
    rationale: "Subscription is described as how the deepest client relationships work. Visual hierarchy guides visitors toward the preferred engagement model."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Hero ship rotation increased from ±4° to ±15°"
    rationale: "User feedback that rotation was imperceptible. 15° is clearly visible without being excessive."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Pricing added as last item in header nav (after About)"
    rationale: "High-intent page should be near the CTA button. Conventional placement for pricing links."
    reversible: true

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs -> /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "Asteroids game is an easter egg — no navigation or docs pointing to it"
  - "Frogger game is an easter egg — Ocho trigger only, no navigation pointing to it"
  - "Industries data is static (lib/industries-data.ts), not MongoDB"
  - "Homepage hero ship SVG matches AsteroidsGame.tsx canvas ship shape exactly"
  - "SVG gradient IDs flameOuter/flameInner used in HeroSection — avoid collisions"
  - "Pricing page copy is original (not copied from the agency model brief verbatim)"
  - "Subscription pricing: from $15K/month. Project pricing: from $30K."

next_actions:
  - "Build Contact page with form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"
  - "Add answer capsules to service pillar pages"
  - "Build chatbot (chaDbot) — copy RAG from AEO"
