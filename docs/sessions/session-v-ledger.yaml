  - "components/home/HeroSection.tsx — CTA → /book (internal Link), added Link import"
  - "components/home/CtaSection.tsx — MagneticButton → /book (removed isExternal)"
  - "components/services/ServiceCTA.tsx — MagneticButton → /book (removed isExternal)"
  - "components/Header.tsx — Desktop + mobile CTA → /book (Link components)"
  - "components/Footer.tsx — Let's Talk! → /book (Link component)"

  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session V section added"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Created /book page with embedded Cal.com calendar via iframe"
    rationale: "User wanted the motion graphics experience (glow rings, sparkles) around the booking calendar, keeping users on-site"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "All CTAs route to /book (internal) instead of external Cal.com URL"
    rationale: "Keeps users on the TSC site with the branded motion graphics experience before booking"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Three.js HeroParticles (same as homepage) added as background to /book page"
    rationale: "User explicitly requested 'the same star motion graphics from the homepage'"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Melissa photo enhanced with 10-sparkle constellation and dual glow rings"
    rationale: "User requested 'make Melissa sparkle more' — she's the person taking the meeting"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Cal.com iframe set to 1000px height with postMessage resize listener"
    rationale: "Calendar was 'crawling off the page' at 600px when selecting dates/times"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Removed 'Let's Talk!' heading and subtitle from /book page"
    rationale: "User said 'we don't need a let's talk button on this page because they're already there'"
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Cal.com iframe may not auto-resize perfectly on all browsers"
    mitigation: "1000px default height covers most flows; postMessage listener handles Cal.com resize events"
    severity: low
  - risk: "Cal.com embed may have CORS or cookie restrictions in some browser configurations"
    mitigation: "Cal.com's embed=true mode is designed for iframe use; monitor for support issues"
    severity: low
  - risk: "Two Three.js Canvas instances exist when user navigates from homepage to /book"
    mitigation: "Next.js client-side navigation handles cleanup; monitor for performance on low-end devices"
    severity: low
  - risk: "56 AI-generated content pieces have not been manually reviewed for quality"
    mitigation: "Spot-check a sample across content types on live site"
    severity: medium
  - risk: "Footer still lists 'Fractional CMO' in services column"
    mitigation: "Remove or rename when fractional CMO service decision is finalized"
    severity: low
