  - "components/industries/IndustriesHero.tsx — NEW: Pillar page hero with dual-glow, gradient text"

  - "components/industries/IndustryContent.tsx — NEW: Market context, pain points, solutions, clients, services, CTA"
  - "components/industries/RelatedIndustries.tsx — NEW: 3-column cross-linking grid"
  - "app/industries/page.tsx — UPDATED: Replaced stub with IndustriesHero + 3x3 card grid + ServiceCTA"
  - "app/industries/[slug]/page.tsx — NEW: SSG sub-pages with generateStaticParams, BreadcrumbList JSON-LD"
  - "lib/schema/breadcrumbs.ts — UPDATED: Added industriesBreadcrumb() and industryBreadcrumb(name)"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — UPDATED: Session XVII entry, Phase 3 industry item marked complete"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "9 industries including MarTech (FAQ listed it, kernel only has 8 primary verticals)"
    rationale: "TSC has genuine expertise marketing to marketers. The FAQ answer is the user-approved source of truth for this page."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Static data in lib/industries-data.ts, not MongoDB"
    rationale: "Industry pages are curated positioning pages — not pipeline-generated content. Static data is simpler, faster, and appropriate for hand-crafted vertical messaging."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Reused ServiceCTA on pillar page instead of creating IndustryCTA"
    rationale: "Same CTA message applies — no need for a duplicate component. Industries and services both lead to /book."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "6 brand colors across 9 industries (some colors repeat)"
    rationale: "9 verticals exceed the 6-color brand palette. Assigned to avoid adjacent repeats in the 3x3 grid. Visual impact is fine."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Some verticals (MarTech, DevTools, Cloud Infra) have empty notableClients arrays"
    mitigation: "The client badge section is conditionally rendered — empty arrays show nothing. As TSC adds clients in these verticals, update the data."
    severity: low
  - risk: "Industry descriptions are hand-written, not kernel-sourced — could diverge from kernel ICP data over time"
    mitigation: "Kernel ICP was used as primary source for pain points. Descriptions add TSC-specific positioning. Revisit if kernel ICP changes significantly."
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "Pipeline infrastructure — moved to Session XVIII"
  - "Contact page with form (Resend integration)"
  - "Answer capsules for service pillar pages"
  - "Leadership headshot photos — still using generative avatars"

next_actions:
  - "Build Contact page with form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"
  - "Add answer capsules to service pillar pages"
  - "Build chatbot (chaDbot) — copy RAG from AEO"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs -> /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "Asteroids game is an easter egg — no navigation or docs pointing to it"
  - "Frogger game is an easter egg — Ocho trigger only, no navigation pointing to it"
  - "Industries data is static (lib/industries-data.ts), not MongoDB"
  - "9 verticals: HR Tech, Enterprise SaaS, FinTech, Cybersecurity, HealthTech, MarTech, DevTools, Cloud Infrastructure, AI/ML Platforms"
