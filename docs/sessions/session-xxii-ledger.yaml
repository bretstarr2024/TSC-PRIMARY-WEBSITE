  - "app/services/[slug]/page.tsx — Wired AnswerCapsulesSection + FAQPage schema"
  - "app/industries/[slug]/page.tsx — Wired AnswerCapsulesSection + FAQPage schema"

  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XXII entry added, upcoming session renumbered to XXIII"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Generic AnswerCapsulesSection component instead of per-section components"
    rationale: "Same accordion pattern reused on services, industries, and pricing — one component with configurable heading/subheading/accent is cleaner than three copies."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "4 capsules per service category, 4 per industry, 5 for pricing"
    rationale: "Enough to cover key buyer questions without overwhelming the page. Can add more later."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "First sentence of every answer designed as standalone quotable capsule"
    rationale: "Follows AEO pattern — AI engines like ChatGPT and Perplexity can cite just the first sentence as a complete answer. Critical for AI search visibility."
    reversible: false
  - decision: "AnswerCapsule interface defined in services-data.ts, re-exported from industries-data.ts"
    rationale: "Single source of truth for the type. Industries imports it to avoid duplication."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Industry page subheading personalized per buyerTitle"
    rationale: "Shows visitors we know their role — 'Straight answers for CISO / VP Securitys evaluating agency partners' is more targeted than generic copy."
    reversible: true

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs -> /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "Service sub-pages (/services/[slug]) still exist for SEO — not removed"
  - "Book page ?service= query param is optional — page works with or without it"
  - "Asteroids game is an easter egg — no navigation or docs pointing to it"
  - "Frogger game is an easter egg — Ocho trigger only, no navigation pointing to it"
  - "Industries data is static (lib/industries-data.ts), not MongoDB"
  - "AnswerCapsule interface lives in lib/services-data.ts — single source of truth"
  - "Every answer capsule's first sentence must be a standalone quotable 20-25 word capsule"
  - "About page already has its own FAQ (AboutFaq component) — not replaced by AnswerCapsulesSection"

next_actions:
  - "Build Contact page with form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"
  - "Build chatbot (chaDbot) — copy RAG from AEO"
  - "Create source monitors for B2B/AI marketing news"
