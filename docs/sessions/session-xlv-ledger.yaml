    message: "feat: Move arcade button below sphere, add starfield fade to contact hero"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/home/HeroSection.tsx — Moved ArcadeButton from inside centered content div to absolute bottom-[22%] position below the particle sphere"
  - "components/contact/ContactHero.tsx — Added h-64 bottom gradient fade (transparent → #141213) matching homepage treatment"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XLV added, status updated, Session XLVI upcoming"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "ArcadeButton positioned at absolute bottom-[22%] of hero section"
    rationale: "User requested 1/3 of the gap between sphere bottom and WhoWeAre section. 22% from bottom approximates this given min-h-screen hero with centered sphere and -mt-20/-mt-28 overlap."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Contact hero gets same h-64 gradient fade as homepage"
    rationale: "User liked the homepage starfield dissolve and requested the same treatment for the contact page."
    reversible: true
