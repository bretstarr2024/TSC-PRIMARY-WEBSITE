    message: "feat: Leadership bio modal, client Frogger easter egg, tequila stat update"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/about/LeadershipSection.tsx — Replaced in-card bio expansion with cinematic modal overlay (backdrop blur, spring animation, 80px avatar, gradient accent bar, prev/next nav, keyboard/ESC support, body scroll lock)"
  - "components/about/FroggerGame.tsx — NEW: Canvas-based Frogger game using client name pills as traffic lanes, Ocho mascot as player, 5 lanes, level progression, touch controls"
  - "components/about/ClientMarquee.tsx — Added Ocho play trigger + FroggerGame integration via next/dynamic lazy loading"
  - "components/about/OriginStory.tsx — Tequila stat: 1,000+ → 100,000"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XII entry added"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Cinematic modal overlay for leadership bios instead of in-card expansion"
    rationale: "In-card expansion stretched grid cells vertically, made bios unreadable in narrow columns, and wrecked adjacent card layout. Modal provides: proper readable typography, scaled-up avatar, prev/next browsing, keyboard nav, and keeps grid pristine."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Frogger game triggered by Ocho mascot in client section"
    rationale: "User noticed scrolling client pills resemble Frogger traffic lanes. Matches the Asteroids easter egg pattern — hidden game that rewards exploration. Canvas-based, lazy-loaded, zero bundle cost until played."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "GenerativeAvatar accepts size prop for modal rendering"
    rationale: "Modal needs 80px avatar vs 56px in grid cards. Added optional size param with 56 default — backwards compatible."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "100,000 shots of tequila"
    rationale: "User directive — escalation of the irreverent stat."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Frogger collision detection uses simple AABB — edge cases possible with fast-moving pills at high levels"
    mitigation: "Player has invulnerability frames on respawn (60 frames). Speed scaling is gradual (+0.15 per lane per level). Playable well past level 10."
    severity: low
  - risk: "Modal AnimatePresence may conflict with layoutId if Framer Motion version changes"
    mitigation: "layoutId is on cards but not actively used for shared layout animation — it's a future-proofing hook. Can remove safely if issues arise."
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "Pipeline infrastructure — moved to Session XIII"
  - "Industries page content"
  - "Contact page with form"
  - "Leadership headshot photos — still using generative avatars"

next_actions:
  - "Review leadership modal and Frogger game on live site"
  - "Build Industries page content (8 industry sub-pages from kernel ICP)"
  - "Build Contact page with form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"
  - "Add answer capsules to service pillar pages"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs -> /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "Asteroids game is an easter egg — no navigation or docs pointing to it"
  - "Frogger game is an easter egg — Ocho trigger only, no navigation pointing to it"
  - "Leadership modal uses index-based selection — if leader order changes, no data loss"
  - "GenerativeAvatar size prop defaults to 56 — existing usages unaffected"
  - "Stats on About page: Founded 1999, 3,000+ B2B tech clients, 100,000 Shots of tequila"
