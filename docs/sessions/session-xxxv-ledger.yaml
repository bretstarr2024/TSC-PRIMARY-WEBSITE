    message: "fix: Restore focus-suppressing CSS on ArcadeButton after Session XXXIV rewrite"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/ArcadeButton.tsx — Restored focus-suppressing Tailwind classes + inline style={{ outline: 'none' }}"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XXXV entry, next session renumbered to XXXVI"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "Belt-and-suspenders focus suppression: Tailwind classes + inline style"
    rationale: "Tailwind classes alone failed in Session XXXIII (possibly due to Framer Motion style merging on motion.button). Inline style={{ outline: 'none' }} guarantees suppression regardless of specificity. Both applied for redundancy."
    reversible: true

explicitly_deferred:
  - "CoinSlotCTA page placement — next session"
  - "Expand Game Over concept to other pages — future sessions"
  - "Contact page form with Resend integration — next session"
  - "Pipeline infrastructure from AEO — next session"
  - "Chatbot (chaDbot) — future session"

next_actions:
  - "Verify ArcadeButton no longer shows square box after game exit in production"
  - "Place CoinSlotCTA on homepage CTA section and/or other pages"
  - "Expand Game Over concept to other page headlines/sections"
  - "Build Contact page form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs -> /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "Pricing page is DONE per user directive — no further changes unless requested"
  - "9 arcade games: all triggered by ArcadeButton (motion.div with role=button, real photo PNG)"
  - "Easter egg games are undocumented — no navigation or user-facing docs"
  - "ArcadeButton uses /images/1_player.png (transparent PNG, unoptimized, via next/image)"
  - "'Game Over' is the site's creative concept — first visible execution live on homepage hero"
  - "ArcadeButton focus suppression: BOTH Tailwind classes AND inline style={{ outline: 'none' }} — do not remove either"
  - "When rewriting components, audit ALL classes/styles from original — don't drop classes that seem irrelevant to the new approach"
