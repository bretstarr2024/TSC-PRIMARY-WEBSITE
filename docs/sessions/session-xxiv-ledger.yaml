  - "components/home/AsteroidsGame.tsx — Added bossActive ref, bossData state, boss overlay integration"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "All game triggers use shared OchoTrigger component (replaced ship SVG on homepage)"
    rationale: "User directive — consistent easter egg discovery UX sitewide. Ocho mascot is the brand's playful identity."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Breakout ball is plain white circle, not Ocho mascot"
    rationale: "User explicitly rejected Ocho as ball — 'I want it to be as true to the original as possible.'"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Boss celebration triggers on #1 high score position only"
    rationale: "Prize scarcity makes it meaningful. Email capture is the conversion goal."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "ArcadeBossOverlay uses capture-phase keyboard blocking"
    rationale: "Prevents game keyboard handlers from firing while overlay is active. Clean separation of input."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "FroggerGame consolidated into single useEffect (was 3 separate)"
    rationale: "Matches Asteroids/Breakout pattern. Simplifies ref sharing between game loop, keyboard, and touch handlers."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "arcade_bosses MongoDB collection stores email, game, score, initials, createdAt"
    rationale: "Minimal schema — just enough to contact winners and identify which game they played."
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Boss overlay capture-phase keyboard handler blocks ALL keydown events from reaching game"
    mitigation: "Game checks bossActive ref and returns early. Overlay handles its own ESC/Enter. Both paths tested in build."
    severity: low
  - risk: "FroggerGame inline rendering (420px container) — game over UI may be cramped on very small screens"
    mitigation: "Used responsive font sizing (clamp/min) and compact layout. High scores show top 8 not 10."
    severity: low

explicitly_deferred:
  - "Contact page with form (Resend integration) — next session priority"
  - "Pipeline infrastructure from AEO — next session"
  - "Chatbot (chaDbot) — next session"
  - "Source monitors — next session"

next_actions:
  - "Build Contact page with form (Resend integration)"
  - "Copy pipeline infrastructure from AEO donor"
  - "Build chatbot (chaDbot) — copy RAG from AEO"
  - "Create source monitors for B2B/AI marketing news"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "All CTAs -> /book (internal Cal.com iframe)"
  - "All game triggers use shared OchoTrigger component — no per-game trigger implementations"
  - "Breakout ball is plain white (not Ocho) — user directive"
  - "Easter egg games are undocumented — no navigation or user-facing docs"
  - "High score localStorage keys: tsc-asteroids-scores, tsc-frogger-scores, tsc-breakout-scores"
  - "Boss overlay z-index 100000 > game portals 99999"
  - "arcade_bosses collection in tsc database for #1 high score email capture"
