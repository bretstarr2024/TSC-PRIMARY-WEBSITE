    message: "feat: Move CoinSlotCTA from hero to bottom CTA, center hero content in sphere"

artifacts_updated:
  - "components/home/HeroSection.tsx — Removed CoinSlotCTA, tightened subhead (max-w 600→480px, mt-8→mt-10)"
  - "components/home/CtaSection.tsx — Replaced MagneticButton 'New Game' with CoinSlotCTA"
  - "app/layout.tsx — Removed CustomCursor (pre-existing uncommitted change)"
  - "components/contact/ContactCalendar.tsx — Cal.com resize: only grow, never shrink (pre-existing fix)"
  - "docs/roadmap.md — Session XLIII added, status updated"

decisions_made:
  - decision: "CoinSlotCTA moves from hero to bottom-of-page CtaSection"
    rationale: "Hero was too cluttered — coin slot competed with headline and subhead. Moving it to the bottom gives it its own moment as the final CTA."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Hero content (arcade button, GAME OVER, subhead) centered within the particle sphere"
    rationale: "User directive: 'placed with intention inside the sphere.' Removing the coin slot and tightening the subhead width keeps all content visually inside the sphere boundary."
    reversible: true
  - decision: "CoinSlotCTA replaces MagneticButton 'New Game' in CtaSection"
    rationale: "The coin slot image is a stronger visual CTA than a text button — it carries the arcade metaphor through to the bottom of the page."
    reversible: true

  - "CoinSlotCTA is now in the bottom CtaSection (not the hero)"
  - "CustomCursor has been removed from root layout"
  - "Cal.com embed resize only grows, never shrinks (prevents page jumping)"
