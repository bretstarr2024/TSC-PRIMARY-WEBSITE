decisions_made:
  - decision: "Pivot Session I from database layer to homepage + services"
    rationale: "User directive: 'Build something beautiful and weird' — creative mandate takes priority"
    reversible: false
  - decision: "Dark-first theme with Heart of Darkness background"
    rationale: "User chose 'Hell yes, go dark' — brand kit supports dark palette"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Downgrade @react-three/fiber to v8 and @react-three/drei to v9"
    rationale: "v9/v10 require React 19; project uses React 18"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "6 kernel service categories as primary service taxonomy"
    rationale: "User chose kernel categories over current-site taxonomy"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "AI-Native as single expanded category with 8 services"
    rationale: "Merged kernel AI services + current site AI services for depth"
    reversible: true
  - decision: "Services data as static TypeScript (not MongoDB)"
    rationale: "Services don't change frequently; static generation is faster"
    reversible: true

known_risks:
  - risk: "Three.js particle field adds ~150KB to homepage JS bundle"
    mitigation: "Dynamic import with ssr:false; monitor Lighthouse scores"
    severity: medium
  - risk: "react-three v8 is not the latest; may miss upstream fixes"
    mitigation: "Upgrade to v9 when project migrates to React 19"
    severity: low
  - risk: "No visual QA completed — user hasn't reviewed all pages yet"
    mitigation: "Visual review should be first priority next session"
    severity: medium

explicitly_deferred:
  - "Database layer (MongoDB connection, content-db, resources-db) — moved to Session II"
  - "Content pipeline plumbing — moved to later sessions per original roadmap"
  - "Visual QA and responsive testing — user hasn't reviewed the full site yet"
  - "Individual service page answer capsules for AEO effectiveness"
  - "robots.ts, sitemap.ts, llms.txt — not yet created"

next_actions:
  - "Visual QA: review homepage and all service pages on localhost"
  - "Copy and adapt database layer from AEO (lib/mongodb.ts, content-db.ts, etc.)"
  - "Build remaining pillar pages: /about, /work, /insights, /contact, /industries"
  - "Add robots.ts, sitemap.ts, and llms.txt for SEO/AEO"
  - "Consider React 19 migration to unlock react-three v9"

invariants:
  - "Database: tsc collection in MongoDB Atlas (never aeo)"
  - "Deploy hook required after every git push (auto-deploy disabled)"
  - "Donor codebase: /Volumes/Queen Amara/AnswerEngineOptimization.com/"
  - "GTM Kernel: /Volumes/Queen Amara/GTM Kernel/"
  - "Dark theme is non-negotiable — Heart of Darkness (#141213) base"
  - "Creative mandate: unconventional layouts, motion as identity, copy that bites"
  - "Services data source of truth: lib/services-data.ts (21 services, 6 categories)"
  - "react-three pinned to v8/v9 until React 19 migration"
  - "All API clients must use pure fetch (no SDK dependencies)"
